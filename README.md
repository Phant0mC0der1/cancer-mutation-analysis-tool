Overview
This repository contains an early-stage research tool for analysing somatic cancer mutation data from genomic datasets. The project is intended as a foundational pipeline that will be expanded with additional filtering, analysis, and validation functionality over time.

Purpose
The tool is designed to support exploratory analysis of cancer-associated mutations, with an emphasis on reproducibility, extensibility, and future integration into more advanced research workflows.

Current Functionality
>Ingestion of mutation-level genomic data
>Application of core filtering and analysis logic
>Generation of summary-level outputs for downstream interpretation

Project Status
This is an initial prototype under active development. The current version represents a starting point rather than a complete or finalised tool. Code structure, documentation, and features will evolve as the project matures.

Repository Structure
src/ — source code for the analysis pipeline
data/ — example dataset for demonstration purposes
README.md — project overview and context

Data
Data from a publically available dataset is used. No sensitive, or restricted datasets are provided in this repository.

Future Development
Planned improvements include:
>Expanded mutation filtering and annotation capabilities
>Improved modularity and code documentation
>Application of statistical tests
>Validation on additional datasets
>Enhanced usability and reproducibility
